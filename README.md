# Python Plotnine Workshop
Python Plotnine workshop organized with **R-Ladies** (Cologne, [Paris](https://twitter.com/RLadiesParis)) and **Pyladies** ([Tunis](https://twitter.com/PyLadiesTunis), [Munich](https://twitter.com/pyladiesmunich)). 

**[Plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)** is a data visualization package based on R ggplot. In this's workshop, we'll explore how to create and style plots using **plotnine** in Python using. The live workshop was conducted in **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)**. 

Workshop materials include a **starter notebook** for participants who want to code along, and a **solutions notebook** with pre-filled code chunks. By the end of the workshop, participants will create a total of 3 different plot types, learning different tricks to improve each plot as the workshop progresses. Participants are encouraged to try creating their own plotnine charts post-workshop!

## Workshop Intro

## Workshop Agenda

This workbook is divided into 5 sections:

1. Set-Up 
2. Data Prep
3. Plot 1: Bar
4. Plot 2: Scatter
5. Plot 3: Density & Facetting

## About The Data

The dataset comes from the **[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)** community. The data is sourced from the [**Open-Source Psychometrics Project**](https://openpsychometrics.org/) and contains personality assessments of different characters in pop culture (e.g. characters from Friends, Westworld, Marvel, etc).


## Plots

By the end of the workshop, participants will create a total of 3 different plots.
